# Creating Discord Bot

2. Log into https://discord.com/developers/applications and click 'New Application'
3. (Optional) Add a short description and an icon for the bot. Save changes.
4. Go to 'Bot' section in the side menu
5. Uncheck 'Public Bot' under Authorization Flow
6. Check all 3 boxes under Privileged Gateway Intents: Presence Intent, Server Members Intent, Message Content Intent. Save changes.
7. Copy the token under the username or reset it to copy. This is the token used in the docker image.
8. Go to 'OAuth2' section in the side menu, then 'URL Generator'
9. Under Scopes, check 'bot' and applications.commands
10. Copy the 'Generated URL' and paste into your browser and add it to your discord server from Step 1.
11. The bot will come online after the docker container is running with the correct Bot Token

# Migration from Invitarr
Invitarr does not require the applications.commands scope, so you will need to kick and reinvite your Discord bot to your server, making sure to tick both the "bot" and "applications.commands" scopes in the Oauth URL generator.

Butlerr uses a slightly different database table than Invitarr. Butlerr will automatically update the Invitarr db table to the current Butlerr table format, but the new table will no longer be compatible with Invitarr, so backup your app.db before running Butlerr!

# Migration from Membarr
Direct migration from Membarr it's not possible at this time.If you know what are you doing then just alter the clients table with the field from dbupdater.py.

# Migration to Invitarr
As mentioned in [Migration from Invitarr](#Migration-From-Invitarr), Butlerr has a slightly different db table than Invitarr. To Switch back to Invitarr, you will have to manually change the table format back. Open app.db in a sqlite cli tool or browser like DB Browser, then remove the "jellyfin_username" column, and make the "email" column non-nullable.
